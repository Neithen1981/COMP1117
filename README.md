# Computer Programming

The course is finally over and I have to thanks two Dalao for helping me with C++. One of them is LGY who is a year 2 CS student in HKU and is now serving as a research assitant of Dr. G. Cui on Operating Systems. The other is @wwpokenet, my beloved boy who always supports and inspires me to work hard.

See you next semester in *Programming Tools* and *Data Structures and Algorithms*!
